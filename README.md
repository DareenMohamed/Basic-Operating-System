# Simulation of an Operating System.

-Interpreter : reads text files (processes) to get data and execute the needed system calls.

-Scheduler :  responsible for scheduling between the processes in the Ready Queue & it uses Round-Robin Scheduling Algorithm.

-Memory Management : The OS manage the memory(non-dynamic size) system and allocates space for each process (the un-parsed lines of code, variables and PCB).

-Process Control Block : PCB contains -> Process ID ,Process State , Program Counter & Memory Boundaries.
